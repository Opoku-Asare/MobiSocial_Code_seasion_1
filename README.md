#MobiSocial Code Season 1

##Overview
This exercise goal is for you to familiarise yourself with Android Studio and do a simple application. This application will make your phone vibrate SOS in Morse Code (... - - - ... , example), for 3 times, when you press a red button on the interface. It should look like this:


##How to use it
* Create a new application in Android Studio for phones and tablets, called CodeSession1, company name mobisocial.oulu.fi, with a minimum SDK of API 14 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Choose an Empty Activity as the template. Call this activity CodeSession1, generate layout file and backwards compatibility is checked.
* Modify the layout to look like the example
* Implement the button callback to use the Vibrator to match the SOS pattern, for 3 times
* Check Android Monitor tab for messages from your application. There is a hint of something missing. Can you spot it? (hint: use the filter on the Android Monitor to find any error messages your app may have).
